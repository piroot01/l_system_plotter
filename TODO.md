# To-Do List

- [ ] Rewrite to libharu PDF generator
- [ ] Automatic fractal centering
    - [ ] Coloring of the fractals based on fractal type
        - [ ] Leafes: algae (so by the context of the l-system)
        - [ ] Multicolor: fractals like Koch curve, etc. (so by number of iterations)
    - [ ] Support for all l-system formats (full alphabet):
        - [ ] Stochastic grammars (randomized l-systems, random rule selection, etc.)
        - [ ] Context sensitive grammars (1L, 2L)
        - [ ] Parametric grammars
        - [ ] Bi-directional grammars
    - [ ] Loading config from extra file, so I can create a library of fractals
    - [ ] Maybe integration with LaTeX
